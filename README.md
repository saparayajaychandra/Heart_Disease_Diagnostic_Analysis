## Problem Statement ❓

In light of our journey through the post-pandemic era, the emphasis on good health has never been more pronounced. The widespread transition to remote work has exposed many individuals to the consequences of a sedentary lifestyle, heightening the risk of obesity and related health concerns. To address this, our project aims to leverage the power of data analysis, including the use of Power BI, in diagnosing and understanding heart diseases.
